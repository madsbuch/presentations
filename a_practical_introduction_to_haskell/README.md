# A Practical Introduction to Haskell
This presentation provides an introduction to software development in
Haskell. We will cover how to set up the environment, basic principles
of functional programming, testing, and input / output. The talk does not
elaborate on any complicated typing concepts, and the talk will take ofset
in knowledge of imperative programming.

## This repository
Essensially what's in here are my notes. The material is presented
a [blog post](#) supported by my ideas on how to eecute a
presentation (_presentation.md_) or workshop (_workshop.md_).

Furthermore this repository contains the example implementation
from the rpesentation.

* `awesomepreter/`: The implementation
* `presentation.md`: Details presenting this
* `workshop.md`: Details doing this as a workshop
* `test.in`: Example code for the awesomepreter
