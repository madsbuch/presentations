_some nice intro_

# Setting / Assumptions

# New Terminology

* ADTs
* 

* Parametric Polymorphism
* Promoted Data types

# Structure

* Motivation / Introduction
    - Avoiding runtime errors by implementing type safety
    - Matrix library as a test application
* Intermedio: Functors of polymorphism (?)
    - Parametric polymorphism
    - Type Kinds
    - Promotion
* Implementation of length typed lists
    - lists as a base for matrices
    - GADTs
    - promoted data types
    - length typed lists
    - standard abstractions/combinators
        + fold
        + map
        + zipWith
        + filter
* Implementing Matrices
    - Scaling
    - Transposing
    - Matrix Product
